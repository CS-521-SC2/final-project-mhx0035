Welcome to Menghao's final projcet.

This project is quiet simple to use and find out results. Because all the data summaries have been run and showed in current ipynb files.

If you want to input your own text and generate some analysis, the only part that you may want to change is in the second extension, which is a simple application that needed input information first. Currently some text have been input as default to better show the results.

For producing these results again, please just follow all the cells from the head to tail.

Hope this would be helpful for you, Thanks.
